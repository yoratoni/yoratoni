### Boilerplates
Here's a list of boilerplates I've created for various projects. Feel free to use them as you wish.
Note that they're configured to suit my needs, including a pretty advanced EsLint config.

- [TS Node Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/ts-node-boilerplate) (TypeScript + Node.js).
- [Nextron Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/nextron-boilerplate) (Next.js + Electron).
- [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/react-boilerplate) (React + Typescript + Craco).
