### Boilerplates
Here's a list of boilerplates I've created for various projects. Use them as you wish.
Note that they're configured to suit my standards, including a pretty advanced EsLint config.

- [Nextron Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/nextron-boilerplate) [Electron | Next.js    | EsLint]
- [Next.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/next-js-boilerplate) [Next.js  | Typescript | EsLint]
- [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/react-boilerplate)     [React    | Typescript | EsLint]
