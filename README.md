### Boilerplates
Here's a list of boilerplates I've created for various projects. Use them as you wish.
Note that they're configured to suit my standards, including a pretty advanced EsLint config.

- [TS Node Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/ts-node-boilerplate) (Node.js + Typescript).
- [Nextron Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/nextron-boilerplate) (Next.js + Electron).
- [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/react-boilerplate) (React.js + Typescript).
- [Next.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/yoratoni/next-js-boilerplate) (Next.js + EsLint).
